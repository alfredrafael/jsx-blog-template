# Bare-bones && Netlify-friendlly JSX blog starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v15 project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and set up to be instantly deployed to [Netlify](https://url.netlify.com/SyTBPVamO)

This project is a very minimal starter that includes 3 blog posts in JSX (with posts and categories rendering), a global stylesheet, a `netlify.toml` for deployment + a `jsconfig.json` for setting up absolute imports and aliases.

### Removing Renovate

In order to keep our project up-to-date with dependencies there is a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate). If not interested in this tooling, delete the `renovate.json` file and commit that onto your main branch.
